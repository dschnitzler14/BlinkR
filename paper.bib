  abstract = {Students often find the fact that a sample statistic is a random variable very hard to grasp. Even more mysterious is why a sample mean should become ever more Normal as the sample size increases. This simulation tool is meant to illustrate the process, thereby giving students some intuitive grasp of the relationship between a parent population and the distribution of a sample mean.},

To date, more than 50 Shiny apps and a growing collection of associated lesson plans, designed to enrich the teaching of both introductory and upper division statistics courses, have been developed. The apps are available for free use and their open source code can be adapted as desired. We report on the experimental testing of four of these Shiny apps to examine short-term learning outcomes in an introductory statistical concepts course.},
