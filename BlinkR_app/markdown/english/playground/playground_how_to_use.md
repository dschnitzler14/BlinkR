### What can it do?
Throughout this app you will come across boxes like this one. Using these boxes, you can write and run R code. This is your **editor**. Once the code is typed or copied into the console, you can press the **run code** button. This will give you an output in the **console**

In most cases you will be able to use the `send code` button to copy a given piece of code to the editor, although sometimes you will be asked to type your own code or edit the existing code!

Sometimes you will see greyed out text in the editor that start with `#`. This is a comment and will not be computed when you press **run code**. 

### Let's try it out.

1. Click `send code to editor`
2. Wait for the code to appear inside the editor
3. Click `Run Code` and wait for the code to print!

```
name <- NULL
print(paste0("Hello ", name))
```

### Now, let's change the code!

1. Change `NULL` to your `"your name"`. So for example, I would write `"Danny"`. Don't forget the `""`!
2. Click `Run Code` again and wait for the code the print.

### Next Steps
Of course we will be using R to carry out data analysis, so that requires some math. 

1. Clear the editor and the console by pressing **Clear Code**
2. Try typing in `2+2` and then **Run Code**

You can you use this console to play around as much as you want!
