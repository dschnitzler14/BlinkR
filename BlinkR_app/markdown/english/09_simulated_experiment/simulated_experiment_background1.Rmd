Caffeine is a stimulant that is commonly consumed in liquid form, such as coffee, tea, and energy drinks.
More recently, caffeine-containing gums have also become available as an alternative means of intake. 
These products are reported to enhance alertness and cognitive performance.

Caffeine has a range of systemic effects on the body. 
One of the most notable physiological responses to caffeine consumption is an increase in heart rate. 
Other effects may include heightened focus, improved reaction times, and potential impacts on metabolism and sleep patterns.
