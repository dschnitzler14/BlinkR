The aim of this study was to examine the effects of caffeine-containing gum on heart rate, compared to a control of caffeine-free gum, chewed for 15 minutes. Given the significantly higher bpm in the caffeine group versus the caffeine free group, the null hypothesis can be rejected and the alternative hypothesis accepted. In order words, the results demonstrate a significant effect of caffeine-containing gum on heart rate, compared to the control group. 

Notably, in one study describing the effects of caffeine (gelatin capsules 5mg/kg) in young, healthy male volunteers (ages 19-22, n=20/ group) the authors report a significant increase in heart rate 60 minute following caffeine ingestion, comparable to the present results (Geethavani et al., 2014). However, this study may not be trustworthy given the lack of effect size, the small sample size, the absence of clarity regarding the statistical tests, and the suspicious lack of decimal differences in mean control group measurements before and after testing. Furthermore, there is a lack of citation for several statements.

In contrast to this, in a study carried out in healthy young adults (ages 23-32, n=10, mixed sexes), participants received a single oral dose of placebo or 100mg or 200mg caffeine dissolved in honey and found that there was no significant increase in heart rate 90 minutes after administration, for either caffeine dose (Sondermeijer et al., 2002). The authors suggest that this surprising lack of change in heart rate may be due to a baroreflex-mediated response to an increase increase in blood pressure. Indeed, in a review examining the effects of caffeine on heart rate and blood pressure, numerous studies reported no effect or indeed a decrease in heart rate following caffeine consumption at various doses, however this does not rule out that caffeine-containing gum may have stronger or more rapid effects, as seen in the present study (Green et al., 1996). 

Furthermore, in a study that examined the effects of infused caffeine in healthy and chronic heart failure patients (n=10 and n=11, respectively), the authors reported a significant decrease in heart rate in healthy patients (compared to the control saline infusion group) after a 20 minute infusion of caffeine (Notarius and Floras, 2012). It is likely that the longer and lower dose of caffeine may have contributed to the difference in results. 

Chewing gum has further been shown to increase heart rate (Allen et al., 2014, Hasegawa et al., 2009), which may serve to explain the present results; it is possible that chewing was increased for the caffeine-containing gum, which itself may have impacted the heart rate due a difference in gum texture or consistency. One suggestion from Hasegawa et al. (2009) is that chewing causes simultaneous suppression of cardiac vagus nerve activity and activation of the cardiac sympathetic nerve activity, leading to the increase in heart rate. 

A further limitation of the study was the mean age of participants; this may not be fully representative of a population that might consume caffeine-containing gum. In addition, while the effect size of the present study suggests that this is indeed an effect, external factors such as prior caffeine consumption, long-term caffeine use, mental state, health, individual metabolism, or medication use cannot be excluded as influencing factors. As already touched upon, the impact of chewing itself may have influenced the results, and it cannot be ruled out how many chews/ minute or indeed the influence of the texture or consistency of the control and caffeine gums may have also contributed to these results. 

Overall, the results of the present study suggest that the rapid absorption of caffeine through the oral mucosa may have rapid, potentially short-term effects on increases heart rate, compared to caffeine-free gum. In order to confirm these results, a longer time-course study would be of interest, to understand whether these effects were indeed short-term. Furthermore, in order to obtain a clearer picture on the involvement of chewing, an experiment might be designed in which caffeine solutions/ rapidly dissolving tablets are held the buccal cavity but not swallowed or chewed.
