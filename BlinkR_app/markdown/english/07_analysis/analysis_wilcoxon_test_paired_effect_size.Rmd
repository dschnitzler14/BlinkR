Now we can calculate the effect size for paired data.  

Effect size helps us understand how meaningful the difference is between two conditions, beyond just statistical significance.  

Since we are using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired data, we calculate the effect size using Wilcoxon’s r. This tells us how strong the difference is between the two related conditions.  

A general guide for interpreting Wilcoxon’s r:  
- 0.1 → Small effect  
- 0.3 → Medium effect  
- 0.5 or higher → Large effect  

```
effect_size_paired <- average_trs %>%
  wilcox_effsize(average_measurement ~ {{levels_variable_name}}, paired = TRUE)
```
