A hypothesis is an educated guess or prediction about what you expect to find in your experiment. It’s a statement that you can test through the data you collect and analyse. In other words, it’s your initial idea about the relationship between different variables you’ll be exploring.

In this experiment, your hypothesis will guide your research focus and give you a basis for designing the experiment and analysing the results. Keep in mind that a good hypothesis doesn’t have to be correct—it just needs to be testable!
