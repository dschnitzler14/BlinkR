This final section should suggest future work to further test your hypothesis.

Using the evidence of your findings and peer-reviewed studies, you should suggest what you would do next to further test your hypothesis.
This could be a new study, a new dataset, or a new method. You can also suggest what you would do if you had more time or resources.

For example:
- If you found that your hypothesis was not supported, you could suggest a new study with a different design or a different dataset.
- If you found that your hypothesis was supported, you could suggest a new study to further explore the mechanisms behind your findings.
- If you found that your hypothesis was partially supported, you could suggest a new study to further explore the conditions under which your hypothesis holds.

The future work should be a clear and logical extension of your current study, building on the evidence you have gathered so far. It should also be feasible and realistic, given the constraints of time, resources, and expertise.
