Your results section should clearly describe all your results.

You can use tables and figures, but you also need to describe the results in words.

You should be specific about the findings, but avoid interpreting what they mean.

For example, you might say that groups treated with drug X had a higher survival rate than those treated with drug Y, but you should not say that drug X is more effective than drug Y.

You also want to make sure you are including summary statistics (means, standard deviations, etc.) and inferential statistics (p-values, effect sizes etc.) where appropriate.

For example: "The mean survival time for patients treated with drug X was 5.2 days (n= 102, SD = 2.3) and for patients treated with drug Y was 3.8 days (n = 106, SD = 1.9). This difference was statistically significant (t = 2.3, p = 0.03)."
