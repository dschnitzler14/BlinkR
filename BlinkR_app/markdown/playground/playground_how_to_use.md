Throughout this app you will come across boxes like this one. Using these boxes, you can write and run R code.

In most cases you will be able to use the `send code to editor` button to copy a given piece of code to the editor, although sometimes you will be asked to type your own code or edit the existing code!

Let's try it out.

1. Click `send code to editor`
2. Wait for the code to appear inside the editor
3. Add this line to the bottom of the code

```
name <- NULL
print(paste0("Hello ", name))
```

4. Click `Run Code` and wait for the code to print!

Now, let's change the code!

1. Change `NULL` to your `"your name"`. So for example, I would write `"Danny"`. Don't forget the `""`!
2. Click `Run Code` again and wait for the code the print.

Of course we will be using R to carry out data analysis, so that requires some math. Why don't you try typing in `2+2` and see what happens?

You can you use this console to play around as much as you want!
