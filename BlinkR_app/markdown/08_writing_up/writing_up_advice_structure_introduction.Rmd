Your introduction is meant to introduce the topic and clearly lay out the evidence that lead you to your research question.
In particular, you should use peer-reviewed scientific evidence to justify the importance of the study.

A lot of scientific writing is a type of storytelling. You should aim to tell a story that leads the reader to the research question.
The introduction should start broadly and then narrow down to the specific research question.

You could start by defining the aspects of the question you are addressing.
Then, you could provide evidence of its importance, and finally highlight the gap in the literature that your study will address.
By the time the reader gets to your hypothesis, they should be convinced that your study is important and necessary. 
The should be tell what the hypothesis will be prior to stating it.

For example, if you are studying the effect of a new drug on a disease, you could start by defining the disease and its impact on society.
Then, you could provide evidence that the current treatments are not effective.
Finally, you could introduce the new drug and explain why it is important to study its effects.
In your hypothesis, you could state that the new drug will be more effective than the current treatments. This should be clearly defined by the evidence you provide throughout the introduction.

Here is a concrete example:
- Define the disease: "Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide (reference). "
- Provide evidence of the problem: "Current treatments are not effective in all patients (reference)."
- Introduce the new drug: "Drug X has shown promising results in studies A and B (reference)."
- Highlight the gap in the literature: "However, no study has compared Drug X to the current treatments."
- Hypothesis: "Drug X will be more effective than the current treatments."
- Alternative hypothesis: "Drug X will not be more effective than the current treatments."

Remember that the introduction should be concise and to the point. You should not include any results or discussion in this section.
