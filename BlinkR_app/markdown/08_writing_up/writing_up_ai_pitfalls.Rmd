**1. Hallucinations & Incorrect Information**
AI often generates false or misleading details, including made-up facts or sources, making it unreliable for research-based writing.

**2. Lack of Critical Thinking**
AI does not analyse or interpret information; it simply predicts words based on patterns, leading to shallow arguments without real insight or reasoning.

**3. Generic & Repetitive Writing**
AI-generated essays often sound formulaic, repetitive, and lacking originality, failing to meet academic standards for depth and engagement.

**4. Inability to Form a Strong Argument**
AI struggles with complex reasoning, logical argumentation, and synthesising diverse viewpoints, resulting in weak or contradictory claims.

**5. Bias & Unverified Sources**
AI reflects biases present in its training data and may pull from unreliable or outdated sources without proper citation.

**6. Lack of Personal Voice & Style**
Essays written by AI lack the unique perspective, creativity, and personal voice that make writing engaging and meaningful.

**7. Poor Citation & Plagiarism Risk**
AI can generate fake or incorrect citations, and over-reliance on AI-generated content may lead to unintentional plagiarism or academic dishonesty.

**8. Misinterpretation of Prompts**
AI does not truly "understand" the assignment, leading to off-topic, incomplete, or misaligned responses that fail to meet the essay requirements.

**9. Inconsistencies & Logical Errors**
AI can contradict itself within an essay, mix up key details, or produce text that lacks coherence and logical flow.
