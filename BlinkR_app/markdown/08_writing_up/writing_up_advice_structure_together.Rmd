Collaborating on a report as a group can be a valuable experience, but it requires good communication, planning, and teamwork. To ensure a smooth process and avoid conflicts, follow these guidelines:

1. Use a Collaborative Document Platform
- Use a shared document tool such as Google Docs, Microsoft OneDrive, or another collaborative writing platform.
- This allows all group members to contribute, track changes, and provide feedback in real time.
- Ensure that all members have access and understand how to use the platform.

2. Plan the Structure Together
- Start by outlining the key sections of the report.
- Use bullet points to draft ideas for each section and assign responsibilities before full writing begins.
- Agree on the style and formatting to maintain consistency.

3. Agree on How to Use AI Tools Ethically
- Agree on how and where you will use AI tools and ensure you are keeping within academic integrity rules to avoid plagiarism, data fabrication, or any other academic misconduct.
- Decide on prompts and how you will verify and refine the output of generative AI tools to ensure accuracy and originality.

4. Agree on a Timeline
- Set clear deadlines for each stage of the report, including drafting, revisions, and final submission.
- Allocate time for reviewing and editing the document as a group before submission.
- Make sure everyone is aware of these deadlines and commits to them.

5. Have a Backup Plan for Issues
- If someone is struggling or falls ill, the group must have a plan in place to redistribute their workload.
- Maintain regular check-ins to ensure that progress is being made and that any difficulties are addressed early.
- If major problems arise, discuss solutions as a group rather than allowing tensions to build up.
- Make a plan for what to do if problems arise and how you will handle these together as a group

6. Take Responsibility as a Group
- This report is a shared responsibility, meaning all members must contribute fairly.
- Each person should review the entire document before submission to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Do not assume that one person will correct mistakes or complete unfinished work.

7. Final Agreement Before Submission
- Before submitting, all members must read through the final version and agree that they are happy with the content.
- No one should submit the work on behalf of the group without ensuring that everyone has had the chance to approve it.
