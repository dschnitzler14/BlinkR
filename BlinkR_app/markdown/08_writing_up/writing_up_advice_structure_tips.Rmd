**1. What do I do if my results aren't significant?**
- Don't panic! This is a common issue in research. It's important to report your results honestly, even if they are not significant.
- Consider alternative explanations. If your results are not significant, think about other factors that could have influenced the outcome.
- Discuss limitations. Be honest about the limitations of your study and how they may have affected the results.
- Consider future research. If your results are not significant, think about how future research could build on your findings.

**2. What do I do if the effect size is small?**
- Consider practical significance. Even if the effect size is small, it may still be important in practice. Consider the real-world implications of your findings.
- Consider sample size. A small effect size may be due to a small sample size. Consider whether a larger sample size would change the results.
- Consider alternative explanations. Think about other factors that could have influenced the effect size.

**3. How do I interpret conflicting results?**
- Consider the context. Think about the context in which the conflicting results were obtained. Are there factors that could explain the differences?
- Consider the methods. Look at the methods used in the studies that produced conflicting results. Are there differences in the design or analysis that could explain the discrepancies?
- Consider the limitations. Think about the limitations of the studies that produced conflicting results. Are there factors that could have influenced the outcomes?

**4. How do I use evidence to back up my arguments?**
- Every factual claim that you make needs to be supported by evidence. This could be findings from your study or findings from other studies.
- Even if you think something is common knowledge, it is still important to provide a reference to back up your claim.

- For example:
- "Previous studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between X and Y (Smith et al., 2010)."
- "Stress has been shown to have a negative impact on cognitive function (Jones et al., 2015)."
- "The findings of this study are in line with previous research on the topic (Smith et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2015)."
- "The HPA-axis has been implicated in the stress response (Smith et al., 2010)."



**5. How do I know if a study was any good?**
- Remember to use your critical thinking skills - some papers are better than others. Look for papers that are published in reputable journals, have been peer-reviewed, and have a clear methodology and results section.
- It is okay if you consider a published study to not be good and to have critiques of it. This is a normal part of the scientific process.
- You can discuss any problems or limitations of a study in your report.
    - For example: "While the present results are in line with a previous study by Smith et al. (2010), the latter study reported a small sample size, which may have limited the generalisability of the results."

**6. I still don't understand how to write this report**
- Reading other papers can be a great way to learn how to structure your own report. Look for papers in your field that are well-written and follow a similar structure to what you are aiming for.

**7. Using Generative AI**
- It may be tempting to use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT to help you write this report.
- However, it is important to remember that these tools are not perfect and may not always provide accurate information.
- It is always best to verify the information provided by these tools and use them as a starting point for your own research.

- Remember too, that this report is a learning exercise for you, and it is important that you understand the content and can explain it in your own words.
