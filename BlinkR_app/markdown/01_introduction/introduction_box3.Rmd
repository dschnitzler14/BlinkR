1. Background and Hypothesis

Begin by reading the background materials provided. Reflect on what you expect the outcome of the experiment might be, and come up with a hypothesis.

2. Protocol Development

Discuss the experiment protocol with your group and submit your own suggested approach. These submissions will be reviewed to create a combined protocol that represents all groups' input.

3. Experiment Session

In the next class session, you’ll carry out the experiment using the collective protocol agreed upon by the class.

4. Data Entry

After completing the experiment, enter your individual measurements into the app. You’ll be able to see your data and, in the next session, review the compiled class data.

5. Data Analysis in R

Use the R sandbox within the app to carry out statistical analyses on the class data. This section will guide you through basic statistical techniques to help make sense of the data.

6. Interpretation and Report Writing

With your analysis complete, interpret your findings and write up the results. The app will provide prompts to help structure your report and ensure your conclusions are well-supported by the data.
