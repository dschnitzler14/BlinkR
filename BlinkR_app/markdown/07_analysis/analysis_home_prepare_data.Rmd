You can think of R like a library of cookbooks, where each cookbook contains recipes you can use to process data. 

In this bit of code, we used a package called `dplyr`. This package is like a cookbook for \"data wrangling,\" which means cleaning and organizing data so we can analyze it. Here's what the code does, step by step:

- **`average_trs <- data`**: This creates a new variable or dataset called `average_trs` using the existing dataset called `data`. Think of it like copying a book and then making edits to the copy.

- **`%>%`**: This is called the \"pipe\" operator. It tells R that we're chaining commands together. It's like saying, \"and then do this...\" to continue the sentence.

- **`group_by(id, stress_status)`**: This organizes the data into groups based on the columns `id` and `stress_status`. Itâ€™s like putting data into labeled boxes so we can work on each group separately.

- **`summarise`**: This creates a new summary column. In this case:
  - `average_blinks_per_minute`: This is the name of the new column.
  - `mean(blinks_per_minute, na.rm = TRUE)`: This calculates the average (`mean`) of the `blinks_per_minute` column for each group. The part `na.rm = TRUE` means to ignore any missing values (\"NA\") when calculating the average.

- **`.groups = 'drop'`**: This tells R to remove any grouping created by the `group_by` step after finishing the summarization. This gives us a clean, ungrouped dataset at the end.

So, the result is a new dataset, `average_trs`, with the average number of blinks per minute for each group of `id` and `stress_status`, ignoring any missing values.
