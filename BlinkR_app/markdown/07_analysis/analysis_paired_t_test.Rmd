This type of t-test is appropriate for samples that are paired, for example repeated measures within the same subject (e.g. before and after).

In order to analyse your data with a two-sample t-test, we first need to restructure our table and then run to the t-test. Copy this whole code into the editor:
        
  ```
  average_trs_paired_wide <- average_trs %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = Stress_Status, values_from = Average_Blinks_Per_Minute)
            
  t_test_paired <- t.test(
    average_trs_paired_wide$Stressed,
    average_trs_paired_wide$Unstressed,
    paired = TRUE
  )
  ```
        
You will notice that this t-test has an extra argument `paired = TRUE`, which indicates that the data is paired.

The threshold for a significant result is pâ‰¤0.05. If your p-value is below this, then the result is significant.
