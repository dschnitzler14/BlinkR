Given that the data is not-normal, we have to use a non-parametric test.

In addition, the data is paired, so we define `paired=TRUE` in our code.

```
wilcox_test_paired <- wilcox.test(
  average_trs$Average_Blinks_Per_Minute[average_trs$Stress_Status == "Stressed"], 
  average_trs$Average_Blinks_Per_Minute[average_trs$Stress_Status == "Unstressed"], 
  paired = TRUE
)
