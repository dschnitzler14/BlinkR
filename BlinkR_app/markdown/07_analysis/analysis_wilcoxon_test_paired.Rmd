Given that the data is not-normal, we have to use a non-parametric test.

In addition, the data is paired, so we define `paired=TRUE` in our code.

```
wilcox_test_paired <- wilcox.test(
  average_trs$average_measurement[average_trs${{levels_variable_name}} == "{{level_a_variable_name}}"], 
  average_trs$average_measurement[average_trs${{levels_variable_name}} == "{{level_b_variable_name}}"], 
  paired = TRUE
)
````
