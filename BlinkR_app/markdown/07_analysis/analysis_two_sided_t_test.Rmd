This type of t-test is appropriate for samples that are entirely independent of one-another.

In order to analyse your data with a two-sample t-test, use this code:

  ```        
  t_test <- t.test(average_measurement ~ {{levels_variable_name}}, var.equal = TRUE, data = average_trs)
  ```

The threshold for a significant result is pâ‰¤0.05. If your p-value is below this, then the result is significant.
