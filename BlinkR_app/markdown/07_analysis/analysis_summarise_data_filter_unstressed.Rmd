In this step, we will summarise the data to obtain a mean, n, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean (SEM) for each group.

I will show you how to calculate these for the unstressed group, but then you will need to calculate them for the stressed group.

First, we will filter the data to only include the unstressed group. Go ahead and send this code to the console:

```
unstressed_data <- average_trs %>%
    filter(Stress_Status == "Unstressed") 
```

With this code, you are taking the column `Stress_Status` from the dataframe `average_trs` and filtering it to only contain "Unstressed" data.

You are then saving this new view of the dataframe as a new variable, called `unstressed_data`.
