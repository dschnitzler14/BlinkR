Now it's your turn.

Let' start by filtering the data to the **stressed** group just like we did above for the unstressed group.

Just like we did for the unstressed group, you need to start with the full, unfiltered dataset, which is called `average_trs`.

Your first line of code is 

```
stressed_group <- average_trs %>%

```
Do you remember what goes in the second line?

**If you get stuck, try scrolling up to see what we did for the unstressed data.**
