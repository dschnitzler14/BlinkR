- The histogram shows the distribution of your data. 
- For a t-test, we typically expect the data to follow a roughly normal distribution. Look for a bell-shaped curve.

- This is the code used to create the histogram in the BlinkR app:
  ```
  hist <- hist(average_trs$Average_Blinks_per_Minute,
                 main = "Distribution of Blinks/Minute",
                 xlab = "Average Blinks/Minute",
                 ylab = "Frequency",
                 col = "grey49",
                 border = "black")
  ```
