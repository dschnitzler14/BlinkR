Next, we can calculate the standard error of the mean (sem) using this code:

```
unstressed_n <- nrow(unstressed_data)
unstressed_sem <- unstressed_sd / sqrt(unstressed_n)
```

In order to calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM), you need to calculate the number of observations (`n`).

So, you define the variable `unstressed_n` to store the number of rows in the `unstressed_data` dataframe.

You can now use this new variable, `unstressed_n` along with the variable `unstressed_sd`, which you defined above, to calculate the SEM.
