Next, we can calculate the mean using this code:

```
unstressed_mean <- mean(unstressed_data$Average_Blinks_Per_Minute, na.rm = TRUE)
```

With this code you are creating a new variable `unstressed_mean`.

By using the command `mean` you calculating the mean of all the values contained in the dataframe `unstressed_data`, specifically the column (`$`) `Average_Blinks_Per_Minute`.
