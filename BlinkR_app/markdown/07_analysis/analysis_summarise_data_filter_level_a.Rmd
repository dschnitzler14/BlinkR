Now it's your turn.

Let' start by filtering the data to the **{{level_a_variable_name}}** group just like we did above for the {{level_b_variable_name}} group.

Just like we did for the {{level_b_variable_name}} group, you need to start with the full, unfiltered dataset, which is called `average_trs`.

Your first line of code is 

```
{{level_a_variable_name}}_group <- average_trs %>%

```
Do you remember what goes in the second line?

**If you get stuck, try scrolling up to see what we did for the {{level_b_variable_name}} data.**
