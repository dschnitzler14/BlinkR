Now you have to decide is this data is normally distributed.

**1. What is Normality?**
A normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve where most values are clustered around the middle, and fewer values appear at the extremes.  

In a normal distribution:  
- The data is symmetrical  
- The mean, median, and mode are roughly the same  
- Most values fall close to the average  

**2. How do I decide if this is normal?**
This can be a little subjective. Look at the histogram and decide if it meets your expectations of what normally distributed data looks like.

**3. Why does it matter?**
The type of statistical test you choose depends on whether the data is normal.  

- If the data is normal, you can use parametric tests (e.g., t-tests).  
- If the data is not normal, you should use non-parametric tests (e.g., Wilcoxon test).
