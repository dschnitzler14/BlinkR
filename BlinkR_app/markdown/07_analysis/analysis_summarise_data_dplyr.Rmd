Instead of calculating each summary statistic individually, you can also use `dplyr` to quickly obtain a table of your results.

```
data_summary <- average_trs %>%
    group_by({{levels_variable_name}}) %>%
    summarise(
        n = n(),
        mean = mean(Average_Measurement, na.rm = TRUE),
        sd = sd(Average_Measurement, na.rm = TRUE),
        sem = sd / sqrt(n)
    )
```

Using this code, you can quickly calculate all the summary statistics for both groups.

The table that is then stored in the `data_summary` variable gives you a good overview of the summary of both groups.
