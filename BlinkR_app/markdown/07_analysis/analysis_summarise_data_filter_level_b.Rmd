In this step, we will summarise the data to obtain a mean, n, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean (SEM) for each group.

I will show you how to calculate these for the {{level_b_variable_name}} group, but then you will need to calculate them for the {{level_a_variable_name}} group.

First, we will filter the data to only include the {{level_b_variable_name}} group. Go ahead and send this code to the editor:

```
{{level_b_variable_name}}_data <- average_trs %>%
    filter({{levels_variable_name}} == "{{level_b_variable_name}}")
```

With this code, you are taking the column `{{levels_variable_name}}` from the dataframe `average_trs` and filtering it to only contain "{{level_b_variable_name}}" data.

You are then saving this new view of the dataframe as a new variable, called `{{level_b_variable_name}}`.
