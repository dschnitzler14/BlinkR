Now it's your turn.

Using the code snipptets provided above, calculate the following summary statistics for the **Stressed** group:

- mean
- standard deviation (sd)

- standard error of the mean (sem)

Just like we did for the unstressed group, you need to start with the full, unfiltered dataset, which is called `average_trs`.

If you get stuck, try scrolling up to see what we did for the unstressed data.
