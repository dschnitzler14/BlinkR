Next, we can calculate the mean using this code:

```
{{level_b_variable_name}}_mean <- mean({{level_b_variable_name}}_data$average_measurement, na.rm = TRUE) 
```

With this code you are creating a new variable `{{level_b_variable_name}}_mean`.

By using the command `mean` you calculating the mean of all the values contained in the dataframe `{{level_b_variable_name}}_data`, specifically the column (`$`) `average_measurement`.
