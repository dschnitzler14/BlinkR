Next, we can calculate the standard deviation (sd) using this code:

```
{{level_b_variable_name}}_sd <- sd({{level_b_variable_name}}_data$Average_Measurement, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Just like with the mean, you are defining a new variable `{{level_b_variable_name}}_sd` to store the standard deviation calculation in.
