Now you have decided on which statistical test to run, the next decision you need to make it whether your data is paired or unpaired.

It is important to choose the correct path, as this influences the calculations that are carried out.

**1.Non-Paired**
- The data comes from two separate groups.  
- Each value in one group has no direct relationship to a value in the other group.  
- Example: Comparing test scores between two different classes. 

**2.Paired**
- The data comes from the same individuals measured twice.  
- Each value in one condition is linked to a value in the other condition.  
- Example: Measuring heart rate before and after exercise in the same people.
