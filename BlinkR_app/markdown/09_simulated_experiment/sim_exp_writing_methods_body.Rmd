This purpose of this study was to examine the effects of caffeine-containing chewing gum on heart rate in healthy participants. Participants were recruited from a student cohort (n=100). Forms consenting to participation, understanding the protocol and purpose, as well as study withdrawal were signed prior to commencement. There were no withdrawals from the study. In order to examine a "real-world" scenario, participants were not given additional instructions, e.g. caffeine avoidance. The study was carried out over two days. On day 1, each participant was randomly assigned a starting group (A or B), with A being the caffeine-free group, and B being the caffeine group. Both the participants and the researcher administrating the gum were blinded to the group identites. Participants were administered either a caffeine-containing (50mg caffeine/ unit of gum, gum brand X, unit size 2g) or caffeine-free gum (gum brand Y, unit size 2g) and timed to chew for 15 minutes. Brands were chosen that resembled one-another in texture, consistency, and size, to prevent group identification. Additionally, any wrappers were removed prior to administration by one of the researchers not involved in administration. Following this, the gums were immediately disposed of and heart rate was measured for 3 minutes, where each minute represented a technical replicate (3 x beats per minute (bpm) for 1 minute). Data was recorded in a secure and anonymised database. On day 2, the process was repeated, with the alternate groups; in other words group A participants received group B gum, and vice versa. Measurements were taken through the same procedure.

Analysis was carried out in R (v4.4.2) using the BlinkR software (v1; Schnitzler, 2024). First, technical replicates were averaged for each participant for each group. The data met all assumptions for a parametric test (continuous, independent, heterogeneous population, normal distribution) (Fig.1) and was therefore analysed by a paired t-test (pairing day 1 and day 2). Furthermore, effect size was calculated by cohen's d using the lsr package (v. 0.5.2; Navarro, 2015). MeanÂ±SEM is given for each group, with n=100.
