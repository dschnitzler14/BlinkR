As described above, given the effects of chewing itself on heart rate, a future study may wish to confirm the present results by administering a rapidly dissolving flavoured tablet containing the same concentration of caffeine or a caffeine-free control tablet of the same flavour. The experimental design would otherwise be similar to the present study, with the exception that a second end point could be a time-course measurement, whereby heart rate is measured 15 minutes after administration, as well as, 30 minutes and 60 minutes, so provide a clearer picture.
