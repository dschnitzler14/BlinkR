You are a researcher who wants to understand if colder temperatures affect the perception of sweetness.

Your evidence to back up your hypothesis:
- You know that the perception of sweetness is mediated by the taste receptor T1R2/T1R3.
- You know that the binding of the sweet molecule to the receptor is temperature-dependent.


You hypothesise that temperature affects the binding of the sweet molecule to the receptor, and therefore affects the perception of sweetness.

You decide to carry out an experiment to test this hypothesis.
