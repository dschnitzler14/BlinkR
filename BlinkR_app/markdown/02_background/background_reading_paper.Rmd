Reading a paper can feel overwhelming at first, but with practice it will become second nature.

Remember to focus on these questions:

- Read it to get an overview of what the paper is about and decide if it’s relevant to your research.

2. Skim the Introduction
- Identify the research question: What is the study trying to find out?
- Look for background information and why the study is important.
- Take note of any key terms or concepts you are unfamiliar with and look them up.

3. Look at Figures, Tables, and Captions
- Visuals often summarise key findings more clearly than reading paragraphs of text.
- Check the axis labels and legends to ensure you understand the data presented.

4. Read the Methods Section

5. Focus on the Results and Discussion
- Results: Identify the main findings—look for patterns, trends, or significant results.
- Discussion: Understand what the results mean in a broader context and how they compare to previous research.
- Look for any limitations or potential biases the authors mention.

6. Read the Conclusion
- The conclusion summarises the key takeaways and implications of the research.
- Consider how this study fits into the bigger picture of the topic you are studying.

7. Check References for Further Reading
- If the paper cites an interesting source, you may want to track it down for more context.
- This is a great way to find related studies and expand your knowledge.

8. Take Notes & Reflect
- Summarise the paper in your own words to ensure you understand it.

**Ask yourself:**
- What did I learn from this?
- How does this connect to what I already know?
- What are the study’s strengths and weaknesses?
