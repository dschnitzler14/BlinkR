Reading a paper can feel overwhelming at first, but with practice it will become second nature.

Remember to focus on these questions:

- **What?** What did they do?
- **How?** How did they do it?
- **Why?** Why did they do it?

**1. Start with the Abstract**
- The abstract provides a summary of the paper’s objectives, methods, key results, and conclusions.
- Read it to get an overview of what the paper is about and decide if it’s relevant to your research.

**2. Skim the Introduction**
- Identify the research question: What is the study trying to find out?
- Look for background information and why the study is important.
- Take note of any key terms or concepts you are unfamiliar with and look them up.

**3. Look at Figures, Tables, and Captions**
- Visuals often summarise key findings more clearly than reading paragraphs of text.
- Check the axis labels and legends to ensure you understand the data presented.

**4. Read the Methods Section**
- If you need to understand how the research was conducted, review this section.
- Look at how data was collected and analysed to evaluate the study’s reliability.
- If you are just interested in the findings, you may skim this section.

**5. Read the Results**
- Identify the main findings—look for patterns, trends, or significant results.
- Do the figures reflect what you are reading in the text?
- Think about how these results could mean before you get to the discussion.


**6. Read the Discussion**
- Understand what the results mean in a broader context and how they compare to previous research.
- Look for any limitations or potential biases the authors mention.
- Do you agree with the author's interpretation?


**7. Read the Conclusion**
- The conclusion summarises the key takeaways and implications of the research.
- Consider how this study fits into the bigger picture of the topic you are studying.

**8. Check References for Further Reading**
- If the paper cites an interesting source, you may want to track it down for more context.
- This is a great way to find related studies and expand your knowledge.

**9. Take Notes & Reflect**
- Summarise the paper in your own words to ensure you understand it.

**10. Ask yourself:**
- What did I learn from this?
- How does this connect to what I already know?
- What are the study’s strengths and weaknesses?
