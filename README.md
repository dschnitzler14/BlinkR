## Overview

BlinkR is a web app written in **Shiny for R**, designed to help students plan, run, and analyse an experiment. It aims to teach the fundamentals of experimental design, good research practices, and basic statistical analysis in R.

The app runs entirely in **R**, and instead of relying on complex databases like SQL, it uses **Google Sheets** and **Google Drive** for persistent storage‚Äîmaking it more accessible and easier to manage.

Originally developed for an experiment comparing blinks per minute under stressed and control conditions (hence the name), BlinkR is now generalizable to any experiment comparing two groups.

**BlinkR can be used for experiments that compare two groups via a T-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test (depending on normality), with three technical replicates. It supports both paired and unpaired data.**

## üëÅÔ∏è How to Use BlinkR

View the demo app here: [BlinkR Demo](https://ds1405.shinyapps.io/blinkr_app/)

### Google Drive Integration

BlinkR uses **Google Drive** for persistent storage. Upon login, each group is assigned a unique 4-digit user ID, which is used to create a session folder within Google Drive. This folder stores text, code, analysis, and figures, and can be accessed via the **"View Google Drive"** button.

This provides:

1. Backup of all work completed
2. Easy cross-device access (desktop, tablet, or smartphone)

Especially useful in shared environments (e.g., computer labs), this system avoids the need for local downloads.

The modal window that opens from the "View Google Drive" button contains a dropdown selector and download button.

### Menu Bar

<img width="339" alt="BlinkR_Sidebar" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8e12597-eff5-4830-87f4-95c224876990" />

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13a18c21-0278-4f52-93a3-c586577472e2

Once authenticated, users see the full menu bar. At the top, the Group ID is displayed. The sidebar can be opened and closed using the hamburger icon in the top left and includes a **Logout** button and **View Google Drive** button (described above).

---

### Introduction & Login

<img width="1565" alt="BlinkR_Intro_Log_in" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c543237-a0a9-4a1e-ad3f-139e74f240c5" />

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f417d055-1070-40d7-a967-6505af0f9478

On launching the app, users land on the **Introduction** tab with a login block:

- **Log in**: Select "I have a Group ID" and enter the 4-digit ID.
- **Sign up**: Enter a unique 4-digit group ID and name, or generate one randomly. If the entered ID already exists, an error will be shown.

Once login or sign-up is complete, the login block disappears and the rest of the app becomes accessible.

## Background

This section guides students in starting background research, including how to search databases like PubMed.

> _No user input required._

---

## Hypotheses

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f12a2b1-328d-4fed-82a9-9405f29a29a1

Guidance is provided for writing:

- A plain language hypothesis
- A null hypothesis (H0)
- An alternative hypothesis (HA)

Users enter these in three input boxes and click **"Save Notes"**, which stores them in their Google Drive folder.

---

## Protocol

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9f63872-bd88-43c8-9d2a-108fbf1f9538

Split into:

### Your Protocol

Users can brainstorm their experimental design in input fields. This can be shared with an educator via Google Sheets or used independently.

### Class Protocol

Shared selectively by the admin (via user base or admin panel). When active, this appears as a read-only tab for users.

### Data Hazards

Students are prompted to consider potential data hazards ([more info](https://datahazards.com/index.html)). Hazards can be dragged into a "Selected Hazards" box, then submitted as a PDF to Google Drive. This file can be overwritten.

---

## Measurements

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0868a4b-0ed0-4283-b61a-6d0b7260fb63

Users add participants, generating unique IDs. Each participant has a "Measurements" box with three tabs:

1. **Consent Agreement** (must be ticked before submitting data)
2. **Level 1 Measurement** (user-defined variable)
3. **Level 2 Measurement** (user-defined variable)

Each measurement box supports three technical replicates. Data is submitted to a Google Sheet and can be overwritten with a warning.

- **Your Group Data**: Editable, showing only the group‚Äôs own entries
- **Class Data**: Aggregated data from all groups, visible only if admin grants access

---

## Playground
