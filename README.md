## Overview

BlinkR is a web app written in **Shiny for R**, designed to help students plan, run, and analyse an experiment. It aims to teach the fundamentals of experimental design, good research practices, and basic statistical analysis in R.

The app runs entirely in **R**, and instead of relying on complex databases like SQL, it uses **Google Sheets** and **Google Drive** for persistent storage‚Äîmaking it more accessible and easier to manage.

Originally developed for an experiment comparing blinks per minute under stressed and control conditions (hence the name), BlinkR is now generalisable to any experiment comparing two groups.

**BlinkR can be used for experiments that compare two groups via a T-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test (depending on normality), with three technical replicates. It supports both paired and unpaired data.**

## üëÅÔ∏è How to Use BlinkR

View the demo app here: [BlinkR Demo](https://ds1405.shinyapps.io/blinkr_app/)

### Google Drive Integration

BlinkR uses **Google Drive** for persistent storage. Upon login, each group is assigned a unique 4-digit user ID, which is used to create a session folder within Google Drive. This folder stores text, code, analysis, and figures, and can be accessed via the **"View Google Drive"** button.

This provides:

1. Backup of all work completed
2. Easy cross-device access (desktop, tablet, or smartphone)

Especially useful in shared environments (e.g., computer labs), this system avoids the need for local downloads.

The modal window that opens from the "View Google Drive" button contains a dropdown selector and download button.

---

### Menu Bar

<img width="339" alt="BlinkR_Sidebar" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8e12597-eff5-4830-87f4-95c224876990" />

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13a18c21-0278-4f52-93a3-c586577472e2

Once authenticated, users see the full menu bar. At the top, the Group ID is displayed. The sidebar can be opened and closed using the hamburger icon in the top left and includes a **Logout** button and **View Google Drive** button (described above).

---

### Introduction & Login

<img width="1565" alt="BlinkR_Intro_Log_in" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c543237-a0a9-4a1e-ad3f-139e74f240c5" />

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f417d055-1070-40d7-a967-6505af0f9478

On launching the app, users land on the **Introduction** tab with a login block:

- **Log in**: Select "I have a Group ID" and enter the 4-digit ID.
- **Sign up**: Enter a unique 4-digit group ID and name, or generate one randomly. If the entered ID already exists, an error will be shown.

Once login or sign-up is complete, the login block disappears and the rest of the app becomes accessible.

## Background

This section guides students in starting background research, including how to search databases like PubMed.

> _No user input required._

---

## Hypotheses

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f12a2b1-328d-4fed-82a9-9405f29a29a1

Guidance is provided for writing:

- A plain language hypothesis
- A null hypothesis (H0)
- An alternative hypothesis (HA)

Users enter these in three input boxes and click **"Save Notes"**, which stores them in their Google Drive folder.

---

## Protocol

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9f63872-bd88-43c8-9d2a-108fbf1f9538

Split into:

### Your Protocol

Users can brainstorm their experimental design in input fields. This can be shared with an educator via Google Sheets or used independently.

### Class Protocol

Shared selectively by the admin (via user base or admin panel). When active, this appears as a read-only tab for users.

### Data Hazards

Students are prompted to consider potential data hazards ([more info](https://datahazards.com/index.html)). Hazards can be dragged into a "Selected Hazards" box, then submitted as a PDF to Google Drive. This file can be overwritten.

---

## Measurements

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0868a4b-0ed0-4283-b61a-6d0b7260fb63

Users add participants, generating unique IDs. Each participant has a "Measurements" box with three tabs:

1. **Consent Agreement** (must be ticked before submitting data)
2. **Level 1 Measurement** (user-defined variable)
3. **Level 2 Measurement** (user-defined variable)

Each measurement box supports three technical replicates. Data is submitted to a Google Sheet and can be overwritten with a warning.

Absolutely! Here's your improved **"Set up and Deployment"** section ‚Äî rewritten for clarity, grammar, and tone while keeping it friendly and approachable. I‚Äôve used consistent formatting, made instructions more concise, and cleaned up the structure so it's easier to follow in `.md` format:

---

# üë©‚Äçüíª Set Up and Deployment

Even if you‚Äôre not familiar with coding, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî this guide breaks down the setup and deployment process so you can use BlinkR with your class, step-by-step.

---

## üì• Step 1: Download or Clone This Repository

To get BlinkR on your computer, you have two options:

- **Option 1 (No Git):** Click the green **"Code"** button at the top of the GitHub page and choose **‚ÄúDownload ZIP‚Äù**. Unzip the folder once downloaded.
- **Option 2 (Using Git):** Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to save the project. Then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dschnitzler14/BlinkR.git
```

This creates your own copy of the BlinkR code. You can experiment freely ‚Äî you won‚Äôt affect the original, and you can always re-download it if needed.

---

## üì¶ Step 2: Install R

If R isn‚Äôt already installed on your system, download and install it from the official site:  
üëâ [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/)

---

## üíª Step 3: Choose a Code Editor

- The recommended editor for R projects is **RStudio**:  
  üëâ [Download RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/)
- For more complex apps like BlinkR, you might prefer **VSCode**, which offers better navigation:  
  üëâ [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Additional setup is needed to run R in VSCode ‚Äî follow these [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r).

---

## üîê Step 4: Set Up a Google Account

BlinkR uses Google Drive and Google Sheets for data storage. You‚Äôll need a Google account for authentication.

> ‚úÖ **Recommended:** Create a new Google account dedicated to BlinkR  
> üëâ [Create a Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/signup)

---

## üìÇ Open the Project Folder in Your Editor

Open the **entire BlinkR folder** (not just a file) in your code editor. This allows you to access all the components needed to run the app.

---

## üöÄ Step 5: Run `STEP0_install_packages.R`

Open the file `STEP0_install_packages.R` and click the **Run** button in your editor. This installs all the required R packages.

- You may be asked to choose a **CRAN mirror** ‚Äî select `"0-Cloud"`.

Once done, you're ready to start the app locally.

---

## üîß Step 6: Run `STEP1_set_up_googledrive_script.R`

Open the file and edit this section:

```r
library(googlesheets4)
library(googledrive)

# Enter your Gmail address
email_address = "appdemo@gmail.com"

options(
  gargle_oauth_email = TRUE,
  gargle_oauth_cache = ".secrets"
)

# Only run these ONCE ‚Äî remove the "#" to uncomment:
# gs4_auth(email = email_address, cache = ".secrets")
# drive_auth(email = email_address, cache = ".secrets")

googlesheets4::gs4_auth()
googledrive::drive_auth()
```

### Instructions:

1. Replace `email_address` with the Google account you want to use.
2. Uncomment the two `gs4_auth()` and `drive_auth()` lines.
3. Run the script.

You‚Äôll be redirected in your browser to authorise access. This happens once for Sheets and once for Drive. Credentials are saved in a hidden `.secrets` folder, so you won‚Äôt need to do this again.

4. (Optional) Re-comment the lines afterward for future clarity.

---

## üß™ Step 7: Run `STEP2_define_variables.R`

This file is in the `BlinkR_app` folder. Before running it, define the variables for your experiment:

```r
experiment_variables <- list(
  measurement_variable_name = "blinks_per_minute",
  measurement_text_name = "Blinks Per Minute",
  levels_variable_name = "stress_status",
  levels_text_name = "Stress Status",
  level_a_variable_name = "stressed",
  level_a_text_name = "Stressed",
  level_b_variable_name = "unstressed",  # recommended: control group
  level_b_text_name = "Unstressed"
)
```

Once edited to reflect your experiment, run the script.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 8: Run `STEP3_set_up_googledrive_script.R`

This final setup step:

- Uses the variables and Google credentials
- Creates necessary files and folders in your linked Google Drive
- Adds an ‚Äúadmin‚Äù user to the user base (you can change this later)

You may need to refresh your Drive to see everything.

---

## üß™ Try It Out!

Ready to explore? Open the `app.R` file and run it. This will launch BlinkR locally so you can test everything before going live.

---

## üöÄ Deployment

Want to deploy BlinkR for your students?

There are several options ‚Äî the most common is via **shinyapps.io**. Here's how to get started:

1. Create an account at üëâ [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/)
2. Follow this guide: üëâ [How to Deploy a Shiny App](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/share/shinyapps/)
3. The `rsconnect` package (already installed in `STEP0`) handles deployment.

Once deployed, your students can access BlinkR online from any device!

**‚úÖ You're all set. Happy experimenting!**

---

## üíª Code Structure

This app uses a **modular Shiny** architecture. Learn more about Shiny modules [here](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/improve/modules/).
